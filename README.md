# FlavorFind - Recipe Sharing App

Welcome to FlavorFind, a modern web application for discovering and sharing recipes. This project is built entirely with a React frontend and a Manifest backend.

## âœ¨ Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user sign-up and login, powered by Manifest.
- **Recipe CRUD**: Create, read, update, and delete your own recipes.
- **Image Uploads**: Add beautiful photos to your recipes and user profiles.
- **Community Feed**: Browse all recipes shared by the community.
- **Role-Based Access**: Users can only edit their own recipes, while admins have full control.
